He gave fifty rural families two cases, (several kilograms), of tomatoes. One case was grown on compost, properly prepared, and the second case consisted of chemically grown fruit. With these cases of tomatoes, he also included a questionnaire regarding the qualities of the tomatoes, The questions were about appearance, colour, aroma, texture, keeping qualities, drying qualities and some other queries.\n",
      "Mr. Rodale was surprised to find that every question was answered with affirmation that the organic tomatoes were superior in all respects, and the chemically grown fruit did not receive a single favorable answer.\n",
      "As he was unsure what the reasons were for this overwhelming positive response for the organic tomatoes, he commissioned the University of Pennsylvania to analyze the chemical composition of both types.  The investigation revealed that the organic tomatoes contained 1938 times more iron, 200 times more vitamin C, 14 times more vitamin A, and the dried organic tomatoes weighed twice as much as the chemically grown tomatoes, and also had many trace elements which were entirely absent from the chemically grown fruit.\n",

Plus, add to it vaccines with heavy metals, cancer \"fighting\" (nothing more than just a profitable business) societies. Contaminated water that contains not only pesticides, it contains also heavy metals, byproducts of medications, pharma drugs that are not water-soluble. This list goes on and on. The snowball of toxic elements grows larger and larger. All of it has an accumulative effect. In other words, the body becomes more and more exposed to oxidation. It is an age where people have to be more proactive to save not only their lives but the lives of their future generations. The evil will do everything to justify their crimes.

Living 4,5 years in Britain, as a Dutchy, I've witnessed the British population's health deteriorating fast. 40% percent of Britain's population is obese, including children under the age of 5. With a conservative government, ignoring to pay attention to education about food and prevention of a lifestyle that damages people's health and therefore a sense of wellbeing, it's not likely that this condition will improve. To me, the choice to choose one's own lifestyle, based on information, is key here. It seems that many British citizens live in a victim role, complacent and largely mind-controlled.\n",
      "Comment by Devon Seamoor: How stupidly selective this scientific research is planned, finding substances in organic eggs, or other organic produce, that aren't supposed to be in our food. Wait and see what an uproar will be present in laboratories, when scientists begin to test supermarket food products, especially processed food. That choice of research needs to be included in the determination of what's safe or not safe to eat. Pure or not pure. The amount of sugar and salt in ready made meals and many snacks, cheap in price, but hardly nutritious, junk-food, is enormous.\n",

I choose organic food for 45 years and work on the land, in my garden and spend time in nature as much as possible. We've become so disconnected from the land and the living Earth, that we lose the clarity of our sensuous relationship with the elements, with living nature, and ignorance of a respect, coming from within, knowing that we're the Earth ourselves, nourished by her substances, air, water, and earth, bringing forth the food that we eat.

Their food gave me diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, head aches, flaked skin, low energy, 5 colds and a flue and I even had a kidney stone. Yet all they could do was brag and boast about their AWFUL food. Their food was so bad that if you fed it to prisoners in jail, there would be riots. I am getting pretty sick of all the abuse I get from organic enthusiasts, simply for stating a fact or expressing my opinion like I am entitled to. Organic enthusiasts can't take criticism and are rude aggressive and in denial. There is no evidence that GMO's are bad, that organic is better for you or the environment or that Monasanto are bad simply for providing GM technology for the greater good. I am more than prepared to have an intelligent debate, but I don't want to argue the toss. I am all ears if you want to talk to me politely, if your capable that is.\n",

SO WHY IS THE PRODUCT SO EXPENSIVE.... wake up. its a sales gimmick creating a new market to become more profitable and in europe to create more jobs by the european union to  justify higher priced food and to justify all the european union jobs that it created to police the higher priced food so people will be brain washed into accepting a much higher out of pocket expense. its a way for europe to create high paying long term jobs that doesnt involve manufacturing cars or refrigerators. its the same here in the US. its all about the mighty dollar and how much profit you make and what it takes to trick people into accepting the high amount of profit.\n",

And it's not just the growers, the loosely called \"FDA\" simply takes kickbacks from food corporations, and overlook anything that isn't allowed.  The list for chemicals that are and are not allowed, put together by the \"FDA\", shows that from 1970 to 1990, there were 20+ chemicals now allowed than in 1970.  Why would they be acceptable in 1990, when in 1970, they were not allowed.  I believe I'm moving to the EU!!!!\n",

Honestly, utilisations of chemically manufactured fertilisers and pesticides are not very conventional, as the term conveys that the methods used are how they have been traditionally throughout human history, which normalises and justifies the use of environmentally damaging chemicals. Therefore, it should be renamed accordingly.\n",

      "3. Products of the current category of conventional farming should be renamed as industrial farming products, as industriously produced chemicals are used. However, not all industrious farming should be discredited and discriminated against as it is a necessary part of our society. Therefore, they should be subcategorised to encourage responsible farming practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3a. Industrial farming (eco-friendly) should be a category of which the industrial farmers uses chemically manufactured substances, whilst all substances used are bio-degradable, non-toxic, non-poisonous and have little-to-none environment damaging effects. The eco-friendly label should create incentives for the farmers, as it allows the consumers to trust the quality of the products, thus, higher prices.\n",

They are forced to turn over their produce to Monsanto, and/or be penalized financially. Meanwhile, their produce is no longer \"organic.\" So why are we paying outrageous prices based on theory here? Until there becomes a time where we are able to \"zone off\" air, and water, so that there is a distinct difference between organic air and water, and non-organic air and water, we will be deceived by labels and exploited by high prices with no guarantee of what is what.

Also, I notice in the UK since 1970s lots of land is set to pasture. Thus would have been grain, crop or animal.
