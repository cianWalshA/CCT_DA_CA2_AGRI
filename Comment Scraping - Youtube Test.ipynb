For Eggs i imagine they'll still have to have some land to produce Eggs and use the chickens for food but Farming is going to become more obsolete in future because Fruit and Veg will be grow in the Aeroponics Warehouses central to Town/City Centers to be able to get them to Supermarkets a lot fresher and quicker. \n",

There are already natural pesticides like Orange for instance... all sorts of bugs hate the Citrus and the Limonene in them Orange Oil is used as a pesticide as a matter of fact especially for Termites it kills them instantly but it's shown to kill other bugs too but i've no idea why anyone won't use it.

      "Comment by The Hermit: IMO, organic farmers should be rewarded for their efforts, not shat upon by the likes of Beyer and Monsanto. The organic farmers should be able to sue those corporations for their loss of income, if their crops fail organic inspections due to contamination traced from neighboring fields. Those fields should have contamination free buffer zones around their perimeter. If these protections were put into place, safer alternatives to 'conventional' pesticides and GMOs would be implemented. That would protect our food chain and ensure healthy nutrition.\n",
      "Besides, the problem is caused by overpopulation, not farmers who want to grow natural organic foods. The solution lies in mitigating overpopulation, especially in more vulnerable and underdeveloped areas, with education and freely available birth control, not growth hormones, antibiotics, battery farming, meat lots, nor producing more contaminated GMO frankenfood with less nutritional value. Humans and natural foods have successfully evolved together for millions of years. \"If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it (just for money).\"\n",
      "Comment by Ail Fawka: Peter Holkenbrink is a lost soul.  Been researching Plants, agriculture and microbiome and organic produce is definitely going to be significantly healthier plant overall and far more nutritionally dense since the habitat the plants are growing in, in general, is going to be far more beneficial for the plant than a habitat/microbiome that is decimated by chemical warfare.\n",

If you've got severe MCS, you feel sick if you eat food that's poisoned with even trace amounts of toxicants. And it's not that they're toxic to MCS sufferers but okay for everyone else. When exposed, we feel sick in seconds to hours. Non-sensitives might not show symptoms for decades, by which time the end-organ damage is likely to be horrifying.

That's why I never eat( very rarely) eggs from stores, even from local farmers to sell as organic, because I know what our chickens eat and I know what is in their egg.

      "Comment by Ken Bellchambers: Around one half century ago, Robert Rodale conducted an experiment to compare organic tomatoes with chemically grown tomatoes. He gave fifty rural families two cases, (several kilograms), of tomatoes. One case was grown on compost, properly prepared, and the second case consisted of chemically grown fruit. With these cases of tomatoes, he also included a questionnaire regarding the qualities of the tomatoes, The questions were about appearance, colour, aroma, texture, keeping qualities, drying qualities and some other queries.\n",
      "Mr. Rodale was surprised to find that every question was answered with affirmation that the organic tomatoes were superior in all respects, and the chemically grown fruit did not receive a single favorable answer.\n",
      "As he was unsure what the reasons were for this overwhelming positive response for the organic tomatoes, he commissioned the University of Pennsylvania to analyze the chemical composition of both types.  The investigation revealed that the organic tomatoes contained 1938 times more iron, 200 times more vitamin C, 14 times more vitamin A, and the dried organic tomatoes weighed twice as much as the chemically grown tomatoes, and also had many trace elements which were entirely absent from the chemically grown fruit.\n",
      "One humus-grown tomato was sufficient to cure scurvy or anemia, whereas an entire case of chemically grown tomatoes could not do so.\n",

I normally compost things such as manure, paper, plant waste, food waste, potash, charcoal scraps, and dishwater. I normally wash my dishes using phosphoric acid as it means less work and if it is too acidic I would add sodium hydroxide water which i use in my soap making. My plants grow fast and healthy. Rather than use pesticides, I tend to grow plants I know insects do not like such as marigolds, mint,  and catnip. I also try to encourage insects and animals that control pests to hangout when i help design farming strategies for local farmers.  As most of them grow rice mice are a problem and cats are a great asset for dealing with those.\n",

With a conservative government, ignoring to pay attention to education about food and prevention of a lifestyle that damages people's health and therefore a sense of wellbeing, it's not likely that this condition will improve. To me, the choice to choose one's own lifestyle, based on information, is key here. It seems that many British citizens live in a victim role, complacent and largely mind-controlled.\n",

The FSA says this anyway. I went to the Glass House college and their food was 100% organic and it was so disgusting that I once went for 5 days eating ziltch! Their food gave me diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, head aches, flaked skin, low energy, 5 colds and a flue and I even had a kidney stone. Yet all they could do was brag and boast about their AWFUL food. Their food was so bad that if you fed it to prisoners in jail, there would be riots. I am getting pretty sick of all the abuse I get from organic enthusiasts, simply for stating a fact or expressing my opinion like I am entitled to. Organic enthusiasts can't take criticism and are rude aggressive and in denial. There is no evidence that GMO's are bad, that organic is better for you or the environment or that Monasanto are bad simply for providing GM technology for the greater good. I am more than prepared to have an intelligent debate, but I don't want to argue the toss. I am all ears if you want to talk to me politely, if your capable that is.\n",

SO WHY IS THE PRODUCT SO EXPENSIVE.... wake up. its a sales gimmick creating a new market to become more profitable and in europe to create more jobs by the european union to  justify higher priced food and to justify all the european union jobs that it created to police the higher priced food so people will be brain washed into accepting a much higher out of pocket expense. its a way for europe to create high paying long term jobs that doesnt involve manufacturing cars or refrigerators. its the same here in the US. its all about the mighty dollar and how much profit you make and what it takes to trick people into accepting the high amount of profit.\n",

Honestly, utilisations of chemically manufactured fertilisers and pesticides are not very conventional, as the term conveys that the methods used are how they have been traditionally throughout human history, which normalises and justifies the use of environmentally damaging chemicals. Therefore, it should be renamed accordingly.\n",

Therefore, they should be subcategorised to encourage responsible farming practices.\n",

Industrial farming (eco-friendly) should be a category of which the industrial farmers uses chemically manufactured substances, whilst all substances used are bio-degradable, non-toxic, non-poisonous and have little-to-none environment damaging effects.

It's cheaper and \"organic\" is just a label for farmers and markets to charge more money. When Monsanto's airborne and \"land borne\" chemicals affect conventional farms, it is the conventional farmers who suffer. They are forced to turn over their produce to Monsanto, and/or be penalized financially. Meanwhile, their produce is no longer \"organic.\" So why are we paying outrageous prices based on theory here? Until there becomes a time where we are able to \"zone off\" air, and water, so that there is a distinct difference between organic air and water, and non-organic air and water, we will be deceived by labels and exploited by high prices with no guarantee of what is what.

Also, I notice in the UK since 1970s lots of land is set to pasture. Thus would have been grain, crop or animal.

And keep in mind that the number of children affected by disorders related to autism is sky-rocketing in the US.
